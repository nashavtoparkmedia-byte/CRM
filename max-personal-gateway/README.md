# MAX Personal Gateway — Stages 1–2

This module implements only the Raw Event Journal foundation. PostgreSQL is authoritative; Redis, browser state, and MAX authorization are not dependencies.

Each physical observation is immutable and receives a distinct `observationId` and monotonically ordered journal position, even when payload, hash, provider event ID, or timestamp are identical. Mutable processing state is stored separately and unique per `(observationId, parserVersion)`. Consumer cursors are isolated by consumer, account, and parser version.

`append` accepts an already sanitized observation and creates raw evidence plus initial processing state in one transaction. The sanitizer is deterministic, recursive, non-mutating, versioned, and records redaction categories without secret values. The sanitized canonical JSON SHA-256 is correlation evidence, never a deduplication key.

No-loss policy: sanitized payloads over the 1 MiB storage policy are replaced by a safe quarantine envelope while the physical observation, ordering, sanitized size/hash, origin, encoding, redaction evidence, and quarantine reason remain durable. Binary values (`Buffer`, typed-array views, and `ArrayBuffer`) are never persisted as credential-bearing bytes; they receive a deterministic metadata-only envelope containing type, byte length, and SHA-256 and initial processing state `quarantined`. Unsupported objects use the same fail-closed quarantine boundary. A following observation is independent and remains appendable.

Raw `UPDATE` and `DELETE` are unconditionally rejected by the Stage 1 database trigger. A caller-controlled custom PostgreSQL setting is not retention authority. Retention is deliberately not implemented; it requires a later reviewed privileged role or `SECURITY DEFINER` maintenance contract. Processing states are limited to `pending`, `processing`, `completed`, `retryable`, `quarantined`, and `dead_letter` by both the adapter and migration.

`MAX_RAW_JOURNAL_ENABLED` is account-scoped and defaults to false. Stage 1 does not connect the journal to the existing listener, sender, Chromium profile, CRM projection, or any provider action. The additive migration is not applied.

## Stage 2: durable Route Registry

The Route Registry uses `(accountId, conversationKey)` as the stable internal route anchor. Provider user IDs, protocol chat IDs, and web route IDs are exact, account-scoped, versioned evidence; none replaces `conversationKey`. Immutable route observations preserve sanitized evidence and extraction provenance, while durable conflicts make ambiguity visible. There is no last-write-wins reassignment: conflicting routes become non-sendable until an audited, expected-version conflict resolution.

`routeVersion` advances only for semantic routing changes. Exact evidence may create or attach a binding; weak web and legacy evidence stays provisional or confirms only an already exact association. Explicit supersede keeps the old identity as history and uses an optimistic version guard. A sendable snapshot is immutable and requires an active route, one unambiguous active identity of each present kind, mandatory active protocol-chat evidence, and no open conflict.

`MAX_ROUTE_REGISTRY_ENABLED` is an account allowlist and defaults to false. Route matching never uses a CRM name or phone, and Stage 2 does not perform Contact resolution. It has no Redis, Chromium, listener, sender, live MAX integration, or provider action. Migrations remain unapplied. Stage 3 has not started.

## Disposable real PostgreSQL gate

The opt-in integration suite never reads generic `DATABASE_URL`. It requires
`PERSONAL_MAX_REAL_POSTGRES_URL`, rejects non-local hosts and the default
PostgreSQL port, and requires a database name containing the
`personal_max_...gate` disposable marker. The database must already contain the
Stage 1 and Stage 2 migrations. A normal unit run therefore never opens a
database connection.

When the generated client is not installed at the normal Gravity package
location, an isolated gate harness may also set
`PERSONAL_MAX_REAL_PRISMA_CLIENT` to an absolute generated-client entry point.
All test data uses unique account/run identifiers. Immutable evidence rows are
removed by deleting the disposable database or cluster; the suite never weakens
append-only triggers or drops shared schemas.

```sh
PERSONAL_MAX_REAL_POSTGRES_URL='postgresql://local-user@127.0.0.1:high-port/personal_max_integration_gate' \
  npm run test:real-postgres
```
